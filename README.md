# bhac-tools
Data reader and analysis tools for the BHAC code

Compile with "make"

Run with: ./BHAC-tools <path/filename> index

Code needs grid.in which should specify the grid input

Check definitions.h for flags that set what functions to use, e.g. 2D vs 3D, ideal vs non-ideal

This is pretty much a work in progress... Use at own risk, or contact me.
